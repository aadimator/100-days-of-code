# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updated PakText, installed and tinkered with Gatsby, installed nvidia-docker and pytorch.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Gatsby, didn't quite understand how to modify it to work with Urdu fonts. I need to learn React first to better understand its workings.

### Day 2: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Configured my system for Fast.ai DL course. Modified a Dockerfile to create an image for the course.

**Thoughts:** My docker skills were pretty rusty. I had to look up a lot of documentation for simple tasks like mounting volumes etc, but it'll get better now, with practice.

### Day 3: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Creating a Docker image for fast.ai course. Will upload it to Docker Hub for the public. Solved a programming challenge on Codewars while the image was building.

**Thoughts:** Modifying Dockerfile has proven to be a lot more time consuming than I imagined it to be. Tweaking some thing and then waiting for an hour to see if it worked as expected or not, that's very inefficient.

### Day 4: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished setting up Docker image and pushed it to Docker Hub. Looked up ways to implement GPS AR. Solved a couple of coding challenges.

**Thoughts:** Selecting tools and ways to implement GPS based AR has proven to be a lot more difficult because of the lack of good resources and documentation.

### Day 5: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved a couple of exercism python coding challenges.

**Thoughts:** Hadn't had a lot of time to work on AR project. Just did some exercises to satisfy the challenge requirements.

### Day 6: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried Gatsby and watched some tutorials on how to modify it. Looked at Hugo as well.

**Thoughts:** Wanted to modify Gatsby or Hugo for Urdu blog. But now, potponing this project for a while.

### Day 7: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created mapbox-ar-unity-khoji. Shows a marker at a hardcoded GPS location.

**Thoughts:** Will see some other related projects tomorrow and look at how they implement these features.
